title: Wikipedia graph structure
---

When we think of wikipedia as a graph, we imagine nodes (articles) linked to others by directed edges (hyperlinks). 

However, when playing wikispeedia, you are not just given a list of edges. You have a lot of text structured in sections, with some hyperlinks in it. You will always see the links appearing in the lead section or the infobox. But how many times will you scroll down the whole english history page to find **the** link you need?

It is thus important to look at the links placement in the articles:
