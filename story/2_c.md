It looks like players that manage to complete their game tend to player differently than players who don't. Let us try to analyse this a bit further. It might be that players who complete the game tend to click on higher placed links? The following plot shows the distribution of the percentage of clicks on the first 10 links for both the finished and unfinished paths.

In fact it does not look like it makes a difference.

Since it is hard to quantify speed for players that did not manage to complete the game they played, let us focus on finished paths. We will make a finer analysis by quantifying efficiency of players. We will define the efficiency of a **finished** path $$P$$ taken by a player as follows:

$$ \operatorname{Efficiency}(P) = \frac{\operatorname{length}(P)}{\text{Length of the shortest possible path between the same start and end points}}$$

So an efficiency of $$1$$ would mean that the player played perfectly. We can now compare the efficiencies with the lengths of finished paths. In fact, the efficiency is highly correlated with the length of the path:

<div class="alert-success" markdown=1>
Here we removed the top 1% of longest player paths and multiplied by 10 the width of the condidence interval for visibility. We also removed the top 1% of outliers in terms of path length. The value of the coefficient $$R^2$$ is 0.76 and the Pearson correlation between the two variables is 0.873. The analysis reveals a highly statistically significant linear relationship between path length and efficiency (p < 0.001).
</div>

So we need to be careful since the efficiency is highly correlated with the length of a path. What can be said about the relation of the efficiency and the duration of the game? By duration of the game we mean the time that the player spent playing.

The Pearson correlation was computed to be 0.48 in this case.

We will now compare efficiency with the consistency of players. For simplicity we will divide the paths in 3 categories: optimal (efficiency=1), Good (1< efficiency $$ \leq $$ 2 ) and Poor (efficiency > 2). This plot shows the distribution of the standard deviation of link positions within each player's path, grouped by efficiency level.

<div class="alert-success">
It might look like less efficient players are less consistent than efficient players. However we just saw that consistency is highly correlated with path lengths.

Here is a comparison between the three variables: Efficiency, Path length and position standard deviation.
